# Theme System Legacy Archive
# Theme System Legacy Archive (NeuroAccess)

This directory preserves historical planning, gap analysis, and verbose implementation logs for the NeuroAccess theme system. These files are retained for traceability and deeper context but are not the primary reference.

Primary doc

- Use `../ThemeSystemOverview.md` for the authoritative, concise architecture & extension guide.

When to consult

- Auditing historical decisions (design/implementation rationale)
- Reviewing incident logs and regression causes

If reintroducing de-scoped features, update the overview first and add cross-links here.
